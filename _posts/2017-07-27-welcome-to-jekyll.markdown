Blogging once came easily. That time was coincident with when programming and I
first fell in love... I made an
online identity and a now ancient website, [mathnathan][old-blog]. Everything I
learned was new and ground breaking! Youthful enthusiasm, and perhaps naivety,
left me with unbridled passion and energy. However, the more you know, the more
you know
you don't know. And unfortunately, the more you know others don't know.
Cynicism crept into my optimistic little heart. Thankfully, after working in
industry, consulting, and performing research, my perspective has once again
broadened. I don't pretend it will be the last time, but for now, I want to
contribute to the cumulative pool of internet knowledge once again! I have
acquired some expertise in [Deep Learning][dl-book] - unsupervised learning in
particular. We have organized local Deep Learning meet ups and workshops. I am
fulfilled when I share what I have learned with others. Perhaps I see a younger
me in their gleaming, wide eyes. 

I will be using this simple [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] framework to make a more
professional blog on github. Nothing but research related information to come...
